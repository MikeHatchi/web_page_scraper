# web_page_scraper

I've made 2 little scripts to scrap some pictures from the web in order to gather enough data to train an image classifier model (CNN).

#1 web page scraper itself
It has been written based on a specific web page.
It can be improve for sure.

#2 exif data cleaning
If you enconter an "exif error" on an linux server when trying to process (or transforming) images, this scrip should help you out to clean these elif data.
